# Details Abput this Board
This 8051 Development Board, designed in KiCad software, incorporates the SPI protocol to facilitate communication between an Arduino and an 8051 microcontroller. The board is specifically engineered for uploading simple programs, given the Arduino's limited storage capacity. It includes connections for an LCD display and a keypad, with the keypad connected to port 0 and the LCD to port 2. Communication pins are allocated on port 3, with pin 6 for MOSI, pin 7 for MISO, pin 8 for SCK, and pin 9 dedicated to reset functionality. The board operates on a 5V power supply and features two LEDs: a red LED to indicate power and a white LED that blinks during code upload. Additionally, a reset button is integrated into the design for convenience.
